Here is the new procedure to talking minutes: 

1. Go to [https://github.com/CodeForFoco/codeforfoco.github.io/tree/master/_posts/minutes][1]
2. Open the minutes template file.
3. Click "Edit" (it's the pencil like icon on the top right when you view it)
4. Copy the full content of the file.
5. Go back to the minutes folder ([https://github.com/CodeForFoco/codeforfoco.github.io/tree/master/_posts/minutes][1]) in the repository
6. Click the "Create new file" in the top right of the window.
7. Name the file, it should have a name like "2017-08-08-minutes.md".
8. Paste in the contents copied from the template.
9. Fill in the blanks in the template. You'll know there are blanks because there are lots of underscores.
10. Save/publish/PR the minutes when you're done.
