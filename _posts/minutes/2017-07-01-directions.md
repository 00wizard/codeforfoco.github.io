Here is the new procedure to talking minutes: 

1. Go to [https://github.com/CodeForFoco/codeforfoco.github.io/tree/master/_posts/minutes][1]
2. Open the minutes template file.
3. Click the "Raw" button. That should open you that document wtih nothing else in your browser window.
4. Copy the full content of the file.
5. Go back to the minutes folder ([https://github.com/CodeForFoco/codeforfoco.github.io/tree/master/_posts/minutes][1]) in the repository
6. Click the "Create new file" in the top right of the window.
7. Name the file, it should have a name like "2017-08-08-minutes.md".
8. Paste in the contents copied from the template.
9. Fill in the blanks in the template. You'll know there are blanks because there are lots of underscores. You can mostly save the structure, or be creative if it's failing you.
10. Commit/PR the minutes when you're done. It's the button at the bottom of the screen you've taken notes on. Which you see will depend on your access rite to the repository.
