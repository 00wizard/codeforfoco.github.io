## Donate to Code for FoCo

Code for FoCo is a brigade of Code for America, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization founded in 2009. We organize around the idea of civic engagement and volunteer projects to help improve and support the local government, charities, and other groups dedicated to improving our society. We are local programmers, hackers, and just about anyone that wants to help that came together in 2016 to bring Code for America to Fort Collins. Though we donate our time for free (usually around 2 hours a week), our group relies on the support of the community around us to help fund our work. If you would like to donate to our brigade in order to provide us the necessary tools and resources to help Fort Collins, please click on the link below to go to Code for Americaâ€™s site, where you can make a donation earmarked for our brigade. If you are interested in going the extra mile, consider sponsoring us for a mention on our website and a closer relationship with our team.
