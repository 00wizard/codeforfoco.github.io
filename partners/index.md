## Partners

Code for Foco's goal is to give back to the community, and part of that is forming partnerships with the community.

Our partnerships are a two way road; without are partners we wouldn't have the means to help the community. In addition, we help the groups that we partner with in any way we can.

## Community

## Government

More to come!
