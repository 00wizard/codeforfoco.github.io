Code for Foco's goal is to give back to the community, and part of that is forming partnerships with the community.

Our partnerships are a two way road; without are partners we wouldn't have the means to help the community. In addition, we help the groups that we partner with in any way we can.

OpenCity is a City of Fort Collins initiative to take transparency to the next level. The goal of OpenCity is to create a web portal to host data sets that are available to the public in a format that citizens can easily search, filter, and utilize in innovative and creative ways. Making data available allows citizens to learn about the City, help make decisions, and be a part of creating solutions.
